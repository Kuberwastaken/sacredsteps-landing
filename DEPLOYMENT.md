# Sacred Steps - Vercel Deployment Guide

## âœ… Fixed NOT_FOUND Error

The deployment configuration has been simplified to resolve the NOT_FOUND error:

- âœ… Simplified vercel.json configuration
- âœ… Removed potentially problematic API functions temporarily
- âœ… Verified build output is correct
- âœ… Using basic routing for SPA

## Current Working Configuration

**vercel.json**:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run vercel-build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration:
- âœ… Explicitly sets build command
- âœ… Specifies correct output directory
- âœ… Routes all requests to index.html for SPA routing
- âœ… Avoids complex API function issues

## Quick Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Kuberwastaken/sacredsteps-landing)

## Manual Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy via GitHub (Recommended):
   - Push your code to GitHub
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically use the configuration

### 2. Deploy via CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel
   ```

## Build Verification âœ…

Local build test confirms everything works:
```
âœ“ 2099 modules transformed
âœ“ Built in ~6 seconds
âœ“ Output: dist/public/index.html + assets
âœ“ Bundle sizes optimized (256KB main, 74KB gzipped)
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Main Bundle**: 256KB (74KB gzipped)
- **CSS Bundle**: 69KB (12KB gzipped)  
- **Build Time**: ~6 seconds
- **Total Assets**: Optimized images and icons
- **Lighthouse Ready**: Performance optimized

## Troubleshooting

### Fixed Issues âœ…
1. **NOT_FOUND Error** - Simplified configuration
2. **API Function Conflicts** - Temporarily removed
3. **Build Output Path** - Verified correct
4. **Routing Issues** - Simple SPA routing implemented

### If You Still Get Errors:
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify GitHub repository is properly connected  
3. Ensure all files are committed and pushed
4. Try manual deployment via CLI

## Re-enabling API Functions Later

Once the static site is deployed successfully, you can:
1. Rename `api-backup` back to `api`
2. Add API routes back to vercel.json
3. Test API functions separately

## Support

The configuration is now minimalist and should deploy without issues. This focuses on getting your beautiful React app live first, then adding complexity later.
